<h3>Projects:</h3>

<b><a href="https://github.com/Ad-Chan/10ManBot">10 Man Bot</a></b> (Deprecated)
- A discord bot I made to help my discord server. It is used for moving members into channels. When we play a 10 man (5v5), we usually had to drag each member of the team into the correct channel, this bot will do it automatically by taking in a match page from our game.

<b><a href="https://github.com/Ad-Chan/os161-OS-asst2">COMP3231 OS Assignment</a></b>
- Tasked with implementing various file system calls for OS/161. Specifically, the system calls implemented are open, read, write, lseek, close and dup2.

<b><a href="https://github.com/Ad-Chan/MapBanBot">MapBanBot</a></b>
- As part of UNSW Esports club, I created a map ban bot to facilitate the tournament events run by the club. This enabled participants to complete the banning process directly on the club discord rather than using an external website.
