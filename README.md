# Adrian's Portfolio


Welcome to my portfolio repository. My notable work will be hosted here. (WIP)



<h3>Projects:</h3>

<b><a href="https://github.com/Ad-Chan/10ManBot">10 Man Bot</a></b>
- A discord bot I made to help my discord server. It is used for moving members into channels. When we play a 10 man (5v5), we usually had to drag each member of the team into the correct channel, this bot will do it automatically by taking in a match page from our game.

<b><a href="https://github.com/Ad-Chan/DungeonGame2511">Dungeon Game</a></b>
- A game made using java as part of an assignment from UNSW's COMP2511 course.

<b><a href="https://github.com/Ad-Chan/ConfigScrape">Config Scrape</a></b>
- My attempt at an automated web scraping program. It uses Selenium to scrape data from a table on the website.
